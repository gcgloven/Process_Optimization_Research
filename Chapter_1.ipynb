    "Queueing network modeling is a high-level approach used in computer system analysis that focuses on the principal components and their interactions, rather than on low-level system details. This method relies on simplifying assumptions to eliminate irrelevant details and to focus on the primary effects that influence the results of the study. \n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions are driven by three main considerations: the need for simplicity, the adequacy of measurements, and the ease of model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach requires a **balance between the complexity of real systems and the practicality of the model**, ensuring it remains computationally efficient while still capturing the essential behavior of the system. Effective queueing network modeling **involves careful selection of inputs, a clear understanding of assumptions, and the ability to evaluate the sensitivity of outcomes to these assumptions**. This methodology allows for different levels of depth in understanding, suitable for readers with varying degrees of experience in modeling studies.\n",
